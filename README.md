Fluxservice Extension
====================

Extends the [flux Service module](https://www.drupal.org/project/fluxservice) with:
- logic for creating, updating and deleting local and remote objects
- provides a queue for storing operations and later execution
- serveral extended classes for easier usage

This was part of my bachelor thesis.
